## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Test Generation Process**

### **Step 1: Plan Your Category**

#### **Category Selection Criteria:**
- **Professional Domain**: Choose a recognizable professional field
- **Rich Vocabulary**: Ensure diverse terminology for engaging typing practice
- **Scalable Content**: Ability to create content across all difficulty levels
- **Unique Value**: Don't overlap with existing categories

#### **Naming Convention:**
- **category**: snake_case for database (e.g., 'education_science')  
- **source**: Title Case for display (e.g., 'Education & Science')

### **Step 2: Content Creation Strategy**

#### **Word Count Guidelines:**
- **30s tests (~50 words)**: Focused concepts, key terminology
- **1m tests (~100 words)**: Detailed explanations, processes
- **2m tests (~200 words)**: Comprehensive topics, procedures  
- **5m tests (~500 words)**: In-depth analysis, complex scenarios

#### **Difficulty Progression:**
- **Easy**: Basic vocabulary, simple concepts, everyday language
- **Medium**: Professional terminology, moderate complexity, industry jargon
- **Hard**: Advanced concepts, technical language, specialized terminology

### **Step 3: Generate Test Content**

#### **Content Quality Standards:**
1. **Professional Accuracy**: Use correct industry terminology
2. **Educational Value**: Include learning opportunities
3. **Typing Engagement**: Varied sentence structures and punctuation
4. **Uniqueness**: No repetitive phrases or duplicate content
5. **Appropriate Difficulty**: Match complexity to difficulty level

#### **Example Content Structure:**

```javascript
// Template for new category
const newCategory = {
  category_key: {
    source: 'Display Name',
    tests: {
      50: {  // 30 seconds
        Easy: "Simple professional concepts with basic terminology and straightforward language that introduces fundamental ideas without overwhelming complexity or advanced jargon.",
        Medium: "More detailed professional explanations incorporating industry-specific terminology while maintaining accessibility for intermediate practitioners learning advanced concepts and procedures.",
        Hard: "Sophisticated technical content utilizing advanced professional vocabulary, complex concepts, and specialized terminology requiring expert-level understanding of intricate processes."
      },
      100: { // 1 minute
        Easy: "Expanded content covering fundamental professional concepts with clear explanations that build upon basic knowledge while introducing more comprehensive topics. This level provides detailed information accessible to beginners and intermediate practitioners seeking to understand core principles and essential practices within the professional domain.",
        Medium: "Detailed professional content incorporating moderate technical complexity and industry-standard terminology that challenges intermediate users while remaining comprehensible.

      }
    }
  }
};
```

### **Step 4: Create Generation Script**

#### **Script Template** (`generate-new-category.js`):

```javascript
// Test Generation Script Template
const { initializeApp } = require('firebase/app');
const { getFirestore, collection, addDoc } = require('firebase/firestore');

// Firebase Configuration (use existing project config)
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyAipHBANeyyXgq1n9h2G33PAwtuXkMRu-w",
  authDomain: "solotype-23c1f.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "solotype-23c1f",
  storageBucket: "solotype-23c1f.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "39439361072",
  appId: "1:39439361072:web:27661c0d7e4e341a02b9f5",
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const db = getFirestore(app);

// Test Structure Configuration
const testStructure = [
  { timeLimit: 30, wordCount: 50 },
  { timeLimit: 60, wordCount: 100 },
  { timeLimit: 120, wordCount: 200 },
  { timeLimit: 300, wordCount: 500 }
];

const difficulties = ['Easy', 'Medium', 'Hard'];

// Your Category Data
const yourCategory = {
  your_category_key: {
    source: 'Your Category Display Name',
    tests: {
      // Insert your content following the template above
    }
  }
};

// Generation Function
async function generateCategoryTests(categoryKey, categoryData) {
  const tests = [];
  
  for (const timeConfig of testStructure) {
    for (const difficulty of difficulties) {
      const testText = categoryData.tests[timeConfig.wordCount][difficulty];
      const actualWordCount = testText.split(' ').length;
      
      console.log(`Creating ${categoryKey} ${timeConfig.timeLimit}s ${difficulty}: ${actualWordCount} words`);
      
      const test = {
        category: categoryKey,
        source: categoryData.source,
        difficulty: difficulty,
        timeLimit: timeConfig.timeLimit,
        wordCount: actualWordCount,
        text: testText,
        createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
      };
      
      try {
        const docRef = await addDoc(collection(db, 'test_contents'), test);
        console.log(`✅ Created ${categoryKey} ${difficulty} ${timeConfig.timeLimit}s test (ID: ${docRef.id})`);
        tests.push({ id: docRef.id, ...test });
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`❌ Failed to create ${categoryKey} ${difficulty} ${timeConfig.timeLimit}s test:`, error);
      }
    }
  }
  
  return tests;
}

// Main Execution
async function main() {
  console.log('🚀 Generating new category tests...');
  
  for (const [categoryKey, categoryData] of Object.entries(yourCategory)) {
    console.log(`\n📂 Generating ${categoryKey} category tests...`);
    const results = await generateCategoryTests(categoryKey, categoryData);
    console.log(`✅ Completed ${categoryKey}: ${results.length} tests created\n`);
  }
  
  console.log('🎉 Test generation complete!');
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

### **Step 5: Execute Generation**

```bash
# Run the generation script
node generate-new-category.js

# Clean up
rm generate-new-category.js
```

## 🔧 **System Integration Points**

### **API Route** (`app/api/tests/route.ts`)
The existing API automatically handles new categories through:
- **Firestore Queries**: Filters by `difficulty`, `timeLimit`, and `category`
- **Data Processing**: Maps Firestore documents to `PreMadeTest` interface
- **Response Formatting**: Returns structured JSON for frontend consumption

### **Frontend Integration** (`app/test/page.tsx`)
New categories appear automatically in the Practice Test tab:
- **Dynamic Loading**: Fetches tests based on selected difficulty and time
- **Test Display**: Shows category name, difficulty, word count, and preview
- **Selection Handling**: Updates typing interface with selected test content

### **No Code Changes Required**
The system is designed to automatically integrate new categories without code modifications.
