# Agent Development Log

This document tracks the completion of major development milestones for the ZenType project.

## January 2025

### ✅ Fixed v1 API Route - Submit Test Result (January 2025)
**Issue:** The `POST /api/v1/submit-test-result` endpoint was returning 500 Internal Server Error due to Firebase Client SDK limitations in server-side environment.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Architecture Change:** Replaced Firebase Client SDK + Cloud Function proxy pattern with Firebase Admin SDK + direct Firestore writes
- **Enhanced Debug Logging:** Added comprehensive logging with correlation IDs, performance monitoring, and structured error handling
- **Security Improvements:** Implemented server-side token validation, input sanitization, and proper error responses
- **Documentation:** Updated API_ENDPOINTS.md with detailed architectural changes and debug features

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/v1/submit-test-result/route.ts` - Complete rewrite using Admin SDK pattern
- `API_ENDPOINTS.md` - Updated documentation with architectural changes
- Created backup: `app/api/v1/submit-test-result/route.ts.backup`

**Debug Integration:**
- Integrated with existing debug utilities (`DebugProvider`, `TEST_SUBMISSION` category)
- Added correlation ID tracking for end-to-end request tracing
- Enhanced error visibility with structured logging
- Performance monitoring with timing and memory usage metrics

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - API route fixed, tested, and documented
